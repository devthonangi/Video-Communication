# CONTENT AWARE VIDEO CODING 

## Overview
This project aims to implement content-aware video coding, leveraging motion activity analysis using FFmpeg's motion vectors and object detection using PyTorch YOLO. By considering motion activity and object count, the encoding process can be optimized for better compression and quality.

## Features
- Motion activity analysis using FFmpeg motion vectors.
- Object count detection using PyTorch YOLO.
- Integration of recommended configurations for optimized performance.
